2024-11-15 19:58:29 airflow-webserver-1  | DEPRECATION: celery 5.1.2 has a non-standard dependency specifier pytz>dev. pip 24.1 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to upgrade to a newer version of celery or contact the author to suggest that they release a version with a conforming dependency specifiers.

2024-11-15 19:58:37 airflow-webserver-1  | DEPRECATION: celery 5.1.2 has a non-standard dependency specifier pytz>dev. pip 24.1 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to upgrade to a newer version of celery or contact the author to suggest that they release a version with a conforming dependency specifiers.

2024-11-15 19:58:41 airflow-webserver-1  | DEPRECATION: celery 5.1.2 has a non-standard dependency specifier pytz>dev. pip 24.1 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to upgrade to a newer version of celery or contact the author to suggest that they release a version with a conforming dependency specifiers.

2024-11-15 19:59:11 airflow-webserver-1  | DEPRECATION: celery 5.1.2 has a non-standard dependency specifier pytz>dev. pip 24.1 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to upgrade to a newer version of celery or contact the author to suggest that they release a version with a conforming dependency specifiers.
